# Trade Table App

This is a React app that displays a table of trades and allows you to add, amend, and delete trades. You can add a trade by filling out the add trade form, which is displayed in a modal when you click the "Add Trade" button. You can update or delete a trade by clicking on a row in the table and selecting the appropriate action from the dropdown that appears.
